# SkillWorld Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the integration process for the SkillWorld application, including the changes made to fix errors and ensure compatibility between the frontend and backend components.

## Changes Made

### Frontend
1. **Added Missing Configuration Files**:
   - Created package.json with necessary dependencies
   - Added tailwind.config.js for styling
   - Created index.css for global styles

2. **API Integration**:
   - Created a dedicated API utility (api.ts) for backend communication
   - Updated AuthContext to use real API calls with fallback to mock data
   - Updated DataContext to fetch real data with fallback to mock data

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized frontend code in a standard React application structure
   - Ensured proper component hierarchy and routing

### Backend
1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Updated MongoDB connection string to use the provided credentials
   - Ensured proper error handling for database connections

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Verified all required API endpoints are properly defined
   - Ensured authentication middleware is correctly implemented

## Integration Points
1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Login/Signup through frontend connects to backend auth endpoints
   - JWT token management for session persistence
   - User profile data retrieval from database

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Posts, challenges, battles, and skill rooms data fetched from backend
   - Fallback to mock data when API is unavailable (for development)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented proper error handling for API requests
   - Added user feedback through toast notifications

## Running the Application

### Backend
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the client directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Notes
- The application uses MongoDB Atlas for database storage
- Frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Backend is built with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose
- Authentication is handled using JWT tokens
